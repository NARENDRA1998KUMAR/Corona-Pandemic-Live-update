# Corona-Pandemic-Live-update

Having refrence from geeks for geeks i have came across a beautiful python code using the request and soup libraries 
by which you can easily fetch live updates of corona cases in india across various states using python .
The libraries that you need to install are :

Pip install BeautifulSoup
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib.pyplot
